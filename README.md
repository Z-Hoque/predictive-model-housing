# predictive-model-housing
In this project, I have tried to build a model that will predict Apartment Prices in Mexico City based on factors like size and neighborhood. I will clean the data, explore with some visualization, build a baseline model, iterate and evaluate it, and finally create a horizontal bar chart that shows the 10 most influential coefficients.
